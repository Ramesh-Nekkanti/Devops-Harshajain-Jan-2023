Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Docker directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hypervisor.
	- VM directly shares the hardware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 			2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM uses hypervisor 						3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performance - Boot up time       4. Native performance - usually boot 
		is more which is in minutes 	           fast in seconds.
	5. Consumes more storage 		        	5. Shares OS storage means only uses 
							   						required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 							6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 

Docker images 
	List images 
		docker images 
		docker image ls 

	Delete images 
		docker rmi <image_name>:<tag>	
		docker rmi <image_id>

	Download an image 	
		docker pull <image_id>


	Create upload a image to docker registry 
		1. Connect to the regisrty account 
				docker login 

		2. Have a image with the private registry syntax 
				docker tag <old_image> <username>/<repo_name>:<tag>
				ex: docker tag ubuntu:latest harshajain/test_repo:v1

		3. Push the image to your regisrty 
				docker push <username>/<repo_name>:<tag>	

	Get only images ids 
		docker images -q 

	Delete all the images 
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)
		docker images -q | xargs -I{} docker rmi {}

	To force delete images 
		docker rmi -f <image_id>	
		docker rmi --force <image_id>

	To delete all dangling images 
		docker image prune		


Docker container 
	- A container is a set of isolated processes and its resources in a host machine which is isolated from all the other process. 
	- Docker uses Linux features to achieve isolation by using namespaces, which allows processes to access only resources in that particular namespace, which allows having a process tree means set 
	of processes that is completely independent of the rest of the systems processes and other processes.
	
	Docker definition: A container is a standard unit of software that packages 
	up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
	from one computing environment to another.

	List running containers 
		docker ps
		docker container ls	

	List all the containers 
		docker ps -a
	
	List only stopped 
		docker ps --filter "status=exited"

	To stop, start, restart, pause containers 	

		docker stop <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>
		docker start <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>
		docker restart <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>
		docker pause <container_id1> <container_id2> .... <container_idn>

	Delete stopped container 
		docker rm <container_id>

	To stop and delete all the running containers 
		docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -q))

	Delete all stopped container 
		docker rm $(docker ps --filter "status=exited" -q)
		docker container prune

	Delete a running container 
		1. Stop the container first 
			docker stop <container_id>
		2. Then delete the container 
			docker rm <container_id>		
			
		smater way:  docker rm $(docker stop <container_id>)
				
	
	Create container from image (Run a container from image)
		docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image>
			-i - Interactive mode 
			-t - enable tty in the terminal 
			-d - To create container in detached mode (in background)
			--name - To assign a custom name to the container 
			--rm - Using this will automatically deletes the container when it stop/exited 

	To check the resource utilized by all the container 
		docker stats 		
			
	To list all the process running inside a container
		docker top <container_id>

	How to login to a container 
		1. To attach to a container 
			docker attach <container_id>
			(To safely exit: hold ctrl + (QP))

		2. To use exec to create a new shell 
			docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash	


	To check the log of all the output process of container 
		docker logs <container_id>	

Assignment: Today's demo 	
				1. push a image to your own docker repository 
				2. create a container from the above image 
				3. Login to the container and install some tools 

			How to copy files / directories from 
				1. host machine to container 
				2. container to host machine 

Dangling Images 
	Dangling images are created while executing layers in image build process that have no relationship 
	to any tagged images. They no longer serve a purpose and it consume disk space.
	
	To list dangling images 
	    docker images -f dangling=true
	
	To remove only dangling images 
	    docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)

   	To delete all unused images including dangling image
	    docker image prune

	docker system prune 
		Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced),
		and optionally, volumes. 
		This will remove:
  		  - all stopped containers
  		  - all networks not used by at least one container
  		  - all dangling images
  		  - all dangling build cache


Docker custom image / Dockerfile / Docker instructions 
	
	Dockerfile
		Dockerfile is used to create custom images by using any stock image or other image as base image.
		In Dockerfile we can write some set of instructions to update any image.
	
		To create image from Dockerfile
			docker build -t my_ubuntu .
	
	FROM ubuntu
		FROM is the first instruction in the every Dockerfile
		FROM is used to specify the base image on top which all the other 
			instruction will run in the same Dockerfile.
			
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>
		
	RUN 
		Normal shell command or the commands supported by the base image are executed using this instruction.
		we can have n number of RUN in a single Dockerfile.
		
		Normal command format 
			RUN <command>
			
		exec format 
			RUN ['<command>','<param1>','<param2>']	
			RUN ['apt','update']	
			RUN ['apt','install','-y','git']	
			RUN ['ls','-lrt']	 

	WORKDIR 
		This is used to set the working directory for all the instructions that follows it.
		such as RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, ADD .... 	
		   
		ex: WORKDIR <path_in_container>
	   		

	COPY and ADD 
		Both copy and add instruction is used to copy files and directories from 
		host machine build location to the image and the container created from it.
	
		ADD supports extra source formats 
	  	  - If the source is a compressed file then ADD will automatically uncompress it 
	    		in the destination.
	      - If the source is a downloadable link then ADD will automatically download the 
	        file in the destination.

		COPY <source_path_from_build_context> <destination_inside_image>	  
		ADD <source_path_from_build_context> <destination_inside_image>	  

Assignment: 
	1. Complete demo COPY & ADD instruction difference.
	2. Create ubuntu custom image with all the required package installed.
		packages: git, curl, tomcat, jq
	3. Create an image from a container.
		a. create a container 
		b. login to above container and create some file/directories 
		c. Create an image from above container.
		d. create second container from above image 
		e. The file created in the first container should exists in this container.


	ENV 
	   This instruction is used to set the environment variable inside the container. 
	   Using this instruction we can create env variables at build time which means in the docker images.
		ex:
			
		   1. For individual variable	 
		      ENV <variable_name> <value>
			     (OR)
		      ENV <variable_name>=<value>

		   2. For multiple variable
	 	      ENV <variable_name1>=<value1> <variable_name2>=<value2> .....

	   To create environment variables at run time (means in containers)
		1. With the docker run command 
			docker run -e <variable_name>=<value> -e <variable_name>=<value>
		2. With a list of variables in a file (.env file)
			docker run --env-file <file_path> ...		
		
	ARG 
	   using this instruction we can pass parameters to Dockerfile as user inputs.
		
		ex: ARG <arg_variable_name>=<value>

		Note: <value> acts as default value to the arg_variable means if user does not set 
		      the arg value at build time this value will be used.

		To pass the value at build time 
			docker build --build-arg <arg_variable_name>=<user_value> 

	CMD vs ENTRYPOINT 
		- Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used to define the default execution command of the container (the command 
	   	  which will be executed in the container as main process).
		- If we use multiple CMD or ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile only the last one will 
		  be considered.
		- If we use both CMD and ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile, then ENTRYPOINT gets the 
	          highest priority and the command defined using CMD will be as parameters to ENTRYPOINT.

		Difference 
		   - CMD can be completely overridden at the runtime (with docker run at the end we can provide 
	   	     the command to override the CMD). 
		   - ENTRYPOINT can't be overridden at the runtime but the command passed at the runtime 
		     will become parameters to ENTRYPOINT command defined in Dockerfile.
		
		Syntax: we can define command in 2 ways 
			1. shell format 
		   	   CMD "ls -lrt"
		
			2. EXEC format 
			   - Always first element is command.
			   - Except first element all the other elements are parameters to command. 

    			   CMD ["ls","-lrt"]  
    EXPOSE 
	     Syntax: EXPOSE <port_number>
	     - Used to expose a port to the docker network so that all the other containers in 
	       the same docker network can access it.
	     - Exposes the port with in the host machine.

docker inspect <object_id>
	- To check the complete details of any object in the docker system 


Docker volume 
	Bind mount 
		- we mount a host location (file/directory) inside a container location 	
			docker -v <host_path>:<container_path>
		- The changes made in host will retain in container and also changes made inside container in this 
		  location will retain in host 
		- If container is deleted host directory will not be deleted (data persistence).
		- It is not preferable to mount a single directory to multiple container. (multiple containers processes 
		  may try write the data to same file which is not possible)

	Volumes 
		- The are docker managed filesystem and we use docker commands to manage these volumes.
		- Volumes are easier to manage, backup and migrate than bind mounts.
		- We can use different source filesystem called storage drivers (EBS, EFS, s3) 
		- Default location of docker volume is /var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume_name>
		To create a docker volume 
			docker 	volume create <volume_name>	

		To delete volume 
			docker volume rm <volume_name>

		To mount a volume 
			docker -v <volume_name>:<container_path>

Assignment: Mount AWS EFS docker volume to a container.
			docker volume create \
		    --driver local \
		    --opt type=nfs \
		    --opt o=addr=fs-0b0e3aa3ba59955ac.efs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com,rw,nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 \
		    --opt device=:/ efs 

		    To test create a file in the cotnainer 
		    	while true; do echo "Dummy data" >> test.txt; done

Benefits of Docker 

	Flexible: 
		Complex applications cab be divided and containerised in small competents called 
		microservice. 
	
	Lightweight: 
		Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require 
		an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs

	portable: 
		we can build images anywhere and then deploy to cloud, run anywhere.	

States of container / Lifecycle of container 

	1. Created - if container is newly created and container is not yet started.
	2. Running - A currently running container. It means there is no problem 
				 with container to run the process.
	3. Exited - A container ran and completed of execution with failure.
	4. paused - A container whose process have been paused. (we can unpause the container)
	5. Dead - if docker daemon tried and failed to stop a container (host ram full)
	6. Restarting - container will be in the phase of restarting the main process.

Docker networking 
	
	Publish 
	Publish will bind the container application port to the host machine port so that 
	we can access from out side world with host machine port.

	Publish = port mapping of container to host machine + Expose 
	
	To publish a port 		
		docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port>
	
	To publish all the exposed ports 
		docker run -P 
		-P publish_all, It binds all the exposed ports of container to host machine. 
	
	To map direct IP address to the host 
		port to port 
			docker run -p <ip>:<host_port>:<container_port>	
		Any to port 
			docker run -p <ip>::<container_port>	
	
	Range of ports 
		many to many 
			docker run -p 8080-8085:8086-8090
			Note: The total number of host ports in range should be same as container port range
		many to one
			docker run -p 8080-8090:8080
			This will map to any one of the host port which is free

	Docker netwrok types 
	1. Bridge 
		- This is a private internal network created by docker on the host machine 
		  by name docker0	
		- This is the default network type for all the container which are created 
          without any network configurations.
		- By default all the containers in the same bridge can communicate with 
		  each other without any extra configuration.	
		- We cannot use container name for communication only IP address is allowed in 
		  default bridge.

		Custom bridge 
			To create bridge network 
				docker network create --driver bridge my_bride 
			
			- In custom bridge containers can communicate with eachother with container 
			  name and also with IP address.
	

		Example: 
			
			bridge      ap1 - 172.17.0.2  ap2 - 172.17.0.3
			my_bridge   ap3 - 172.18.0.2  ap4 - 172.18.0.3    

			Check Ping
    				1) Check can we ping by the name 
        				
    
    				2) Check bridge to bridge communication 
        				ap1 -> ap3 or ap4 

	2. Host 		  
		- This driver removes the network isolation between docker and the host.
		- The containers are directly connected to host machine network without  
		  extra layer of any docker network.
		- Shares the same TCP.IP stack and same namespace of host machine.  
		- All the network interfaces which are there in host machine are 
		  accessible by this container.

	3. None 
		- Containers are not attached to any network by docker.
		- All the required network configurations need to be done 
		  manually.
		- The host or any other containers won't be able to communicate 
		  with this container until a custom network is configured.

	Overlay 
		- Overlay networks are meant to define network communication of containers hosted on different host machines. 
		- To create such a network we use the ‘overlay’ driver. 
		- The overlay driver is a native driver by docker that helps to create a single layer2 broadcast domain across containers 
		  hosted on multiple Docker host machines.

Docker Architecture 

	Docker Daemon 
		- A background process that manages docker images, containers, network and volumes.
		- This Daemon constantly listens for docker API request and processes them.
	
	Docker REST API 
		- API which is used by applications to interact with the docker daemon. 
		
	Docker CLI 
		- It is a command line interface for interacting with docker daemon through
		  REST api.
	
	Docker Objects 
		- Images, Containers, Networks, Vloumes

Multistage build 
	How to optimise docker build process ?
	How to reduce the size of the docker image or container ? 

	After docker 1.6 version docker released this option.
	1. There are 2 problems with the normal build process 
			1. Size: challenge is to keep the image and its containers size as minimal as  		
			   possible.
			2. larger the surface area more the application is vulnerable to attacks. 
	
		- Multistage build allows us to define multiple FROM in same Dockerfile.
		- Dependency between multiple FROM is maintained by naming FROM using 
		  AS keyword and we can refer this name in another FROM.

				FROM <base_image> AS <STAGE_NAME>
				
		- Only the final FROM image is created leaving back all the other FROM images / stages.
		- Copy only the required files from the named FROM stage like below.
				FROM final_build
				COPY --from <STAGE_NAME> <src_named_stage> <dest>
	
	2. Always try to use the slim / alpine / stretch version of base image instead 
	   of using the fully loaded latest base image.
	   
Docker compose 
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
Step 1 − Download the necessary files from github using the following command −
		curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.10.0-rc2/dockercompose-$(uname -s) -$(uname -m)" -o /home/demo/docker-compose
		docker-compose version
