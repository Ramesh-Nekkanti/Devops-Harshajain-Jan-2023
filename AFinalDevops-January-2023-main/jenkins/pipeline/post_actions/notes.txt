post
post block contains additional actions to be performed on completion of the pipeline execution. It can contain one or many of the following conditional blocks – always, changed, aborted, failure, success, unstable etc.

post block conditions

always – run this post block irrespective of the pipeline execution status
changed – run this post block only if the pipeline’s execution status is different from the previous build run. E.g., the build failed at an earlier run & ran successfully this time.
aborted – if the build is aborted in the middle of the run. Usually due to manual stopping of the build run
failure – if the build status is failure.
success – if the build ran successfully.
unstable – build is successful but not healthy. E.g. On a particular build run, test cases ran successfully, but test coverage % is less than expected, then the build can be marked as unstable
